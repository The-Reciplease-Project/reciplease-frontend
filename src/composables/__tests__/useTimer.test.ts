// Start with an array of recipe steps

// Each step, when added, will have startTime, endTime, hasStarted, and hasEnded initialized to null/false
// Each step, when added, will have a uniqueId
// When added, each step will be pushed to the steps array
// When removed, that step will be removed from the steps array

// When started, the step's startTime will be set to the current time and hasStarted will be true
// When ended, the step's endTime will be set to the current time and hasEnded will be true
